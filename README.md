## 🎯 Overview

This project implements the Tic-Tac-Toe game with the following characteristics:

✔ Two-player mode (Human vs Human)  
✔ Simple and intuitive console interface  
✔ Well-structured game logic  
✔ Modular code separation for reusable logic  
✔ Easily extendable for enhancements (AI, GUI, web)
